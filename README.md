## Development Guidelines

> [VSCode Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) is used to create an isolated development environment and avoid conflicts with other locally installed tools.

### System Requirements

- [Docker](https://docker.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Cloning the project

#### Using the `gh` CLI:

```sh
gh repo clone elkevinwolf/dynapic
```

#### Using `https`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elkevinwolf/dynapic.git
```

#### Using `ssh`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:elkevinwolf/dynapic.git
```

### Opening the Development Container

Open the cloned project in VS Code. Once you open it, you will see a popup with the text `Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container.`, click the `Re-open in Container` button and a new Docker container will be created and dependencies will be automatically installed for you.

### Running the Development Server

With the project open in the Development Container, open the VSCode Integrated Terminal and enter `npm run dev`. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you will see the application up and running.

### Contributing

1. Create a new branch off of `main`
2. Work on your changes, create as many commits as you need
3. Open a Pull Request and set `main` as your base branch
4. Once it has been approved and tested, it will be **squash-merged** into `main` and your changes will be live ðŸš€

### Code Conventions

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) with the [`@elkevinwolf/prettier-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elkevinwolf/prettier-config) config and [ESlint](https://eslint.org) with the [`@elkevinwolf/eslint-config-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elkevinwolf/eslint-config-react) are used to ensure good and concise coding standards.

### Commit conventions

All commits in the `main` branch should follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Commits in other branches or Pull Requests doesn't need to follow the convention, since they will eventually be **squash-merged** into `main` using the above convention.

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

Whenever a push happens, a [GitHub Action](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) will validate the code, by building, linting, and testing the application.

The `main` branch points to the production environment in [Railway](https://railway.app), while Pull Requests will provision temporary environments for testing.
